The following instructions are for using the SSB modeling software developed by
Alexa Putnam Shilleh from the University of Colorado Boulder.

Step-3: Execute least squares to find the SSB model
 - (a) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--> Open "run_data2matrices_ext.py" and define:
        MISSIONNAME: input string corresponding to mission name
            options: 
                'tx' for Topex/Poseidon
                'j1' or 'j2' or 'j3' for Jason missions 1-3
                's6A' for Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich
                
        MNtag: define year of data used to create model
            ** see README_MNtag
        
        METHOD: input string corresponding to data method
            options:
                'dir': for an alongtrack (DIR or COE) model
                'xov': for crossover (XOV) model
                'col': for collinear (COL) model
                'jnt': for joint (JNT) model
                'coe': for coestimated (COE) model
                
        SOURCE: input string corresponding to altimeter data source
            options:
                "jpl" for data received from JPL files
                "aviso" for data received from AVISO
                "rads" for data received from RADS software
            ** additional sources can be added in lib_dict_ext.py/product_paths
                if a new source is added then be sure to make a new directory
                corresponding to the source name in ~/imssb_software/output/mn_template/product2data/
                
               
        DIM: input string corresponding to second dimension (the first dimension = SWH)
            default: DIM = 'u10'
            options:
                altimeter wind speed: 'u10'
                backscatter coefficient: 'sig0'
            ** more options can be added in lib_geo_gridding_ext.py/grid_dimensions
                this function allows you to define a new parameter, as well as
                resize the current parameters.
                    i.e. dx and x_grid define the bin spacing and nodes for the 
                    SWH axis, respectively.
            
        OMIT: enter string to define a third dimension, or leave as empty bracket
            default (2D model): OMIT = []
            options for a 3D model: 
                mean wave period: 'mean_wave_period_t02'
            ** more options can be added in lib_geo_gridding_ext.py/grid_dimensions
                this function allows you to define a new parameter, as well as
                resize the current parameters.
                    i.e. dz and z_grid define the bin spacing and nodes for the 
                    Z axis, respectively.
            
        WEIGHT: True or False
            default: WEIGHT = False
            options:
                True: weight measurements based on latitude
                False: do not weight measurements based on latitude                
               

--> Run "run_matrices2models_ext.py" in command line

~~~ Additional notes ~~~~~
 
Commands:
The aforementioned steps can be carried-out using the following commands within the terminal:
    7. >> cd /path/to/your/directory/imssb_software/iSSB_functions/
    8. >> vi run_matrices2models_ext.py
        ◦ edit inputs
    9. >> python run_matrices2models_ext.py

Example:
A model with the inputs:
    • MISSIONNAME = ‘j2’ [position (1)]
    • Mntag = ‘y2’ [positions (6a) & (6b)]
    • METHOD = ‘dir’ [position (2)]
    • SOURCE = ‘jpl’ [position (5)]
    • DIM = ‘u10’ [position (8)]
    • OMIT = [] [position (9)]
    • WEIGHT = True [position (10)]
will produce both Ku- and C-band models in “~/imssb_software/output/MISSIONNAME/METHOD/matrix2model/” with the file names representing the input:
    • (1)_(2)_(3)_(4)_(5)_(6a)_c_(6b)_(7)_(8)_(9)_(10).nc
where, additional information includes;
    • [position (3)] dependent variable 
    • [position (4)] software step
    • [position (7)] frequency band
The resulting file names in this example are;
    • j2_dir_ssb_matrix2model_jpl_19_c_55_ku_u10_2d_LatWgt.nc
    • j2_dir_ssb_matrix2model_jpl_19_c_55_c_u10_2d_LatWgt.nc
