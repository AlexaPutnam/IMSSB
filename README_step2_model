The following instructions are for using the SSB modeling software developed by
Alexa Putnam Shilleh from the University of Colorado Boulder. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step-2: Filter and convert along-track cycle files to observation files 
 - (a) filter and convert along-track cycle files to along-track observation 
        matrices and observation vectors.
        ** direct, along-track observation vectors and matrices must first be created  without added error (ERR=[]).
        ** added error and difference observation vectors and matrices require direct files 
   (b) optional: create crossover and collinear difference observation matrices 
        and observation vectors, as well as observation matrices and vectors with 
        added error, from along-track matrices and vectors.

--> Open "run_data2matrices_ext.py" and define:
        MISSIONNAME: input string corresponding to mission name
            options: 
                'tx' for Topex/Poseidon
                'j1' or 'j2' or 'j3' for Jason missions 1-3
                's6A' for Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich
                
        cyc: an array containing the numbers for each cycle that will be processed
            i.e. cyc = np.arange(48,101)
            (Bad cycles will be removed. This can be check in lib_dict_ext.py/bad_cycles)
        
        METHOD: input string corresponding to data method
            options:
                'dir': for direct (along-track) measurements
                'xov': for crossover differences
                'col': for collinear differences
            ** 'dir' files must first be created before generating 'xov' and 
                'col' files.
                
        SOURCE: input string corresponding to altimeter data source
            options:
                'jpl' for data received from JPL files
                'aviso' for data received from AVISO
                'rads' for data received from RADS software
            ** additional sources can be added in lib_dict_ext.py/product_paths
                if a new source is added then be sure to make a new directory
                corresponding to the source name in ~/imssb_software/output/mission_name/product2data/
                
        ERR: enter string to define independent-variable error/analysis, or leave as empty bracket
            options:
                nominal model, no added error: []
                tandem analysis: 'j2j3','j1j2', or 'txj1'
                    e.g. jason-2 and jason-3 tandem analysis = 'j2j3'
                create mle3 SSB model: 'mle3'
                add noise for error analysis:'rms_w','rms_s' or 'rms_'ws'
                    ** _w = added SWH error, _s = added sig0 error
                smooth SWH measurements more than 1Hz: 'smth_swh'
                pseuro low resolution mode (plrm) analysis: 'plrm'
             ** more options can be added in lib_data_ext.py/pull_observables
             
        GEO: True or False
            options:
                True: generate observation matrices and vectors required for all
                    model types (i.e. DIR, XOV, COL, JNT and COE), as well as 
                    additional matrices required for coestimated (COE) model
                    See thesis for details.
                False: only generate observaion matrices and vectors required
                    for direct (DIR), collinear (COL), crossover (XOV) and 
                    joint (JNT) models. See thesis for details.
                    
        MSS: True or False
            options:
                True: interpolate additional MSS (CNES 2011 and 2015) solutions
                False: do not add new MSS solution
            ** currently interpolates CNES 2011 and 2015 solutions, but this can be changed
                in lib_geo_gridding_ext.py/spline_interp_mss and main_data2matrices.py/data2matrices
               
        DIM: input string corresponding to second dimension (the first dimension = SWH)
            options:
                altimeter wind speed (nominal): 'u10'
                backscatter coefficient: 'sig0'
            ** more options can be added in lib_geo_gridding_ext.py/grid_dimensions
                this function allows you to define a new parameter, as well as
                resize the current parameters.
                    i.e. dx and x_grid define the bin spacing and nodes for the 
                    SWH axis, respectively.
            
        OMIT: enter string to define a third dimension, or leave as empty bracket
            default (2D model): OMIT = []
            options for a 3D model: 
                mean wave period: 'mean_wave_period_t02'
            ** more options can be added in lib_geo_gridding_ext.py/grid_dimensions
                this function allows you to define a new parameter, as well as
                resize the current parameters.
                    i.e. dz and z_grid define the bin spacing and nodes for the 
                    Z axis, respectively.


--> Run "run_data2matrices_ext.py" in command line 

~~~~ Additional notes ~~~~~
Commands:
The aforementioned steps can be carried-out using the following commands within the terminal:
    4. >> cd /path/to/your/directory/imssb_software/iSSB_functions/
    5. >> vi run_data2matrices_ext.py
        ◦ edit inputs
    6. >> python run_data2matrices_ext.py

Example:
Running run_data2matrices_ext.py with the inputs:
    • MISSIONNAME = ‘j2’ [position (1)]
    • cyc = np.arange(19,20) [positions (6a) & (6b)]
    • METHOD = ‘dir’ [position (2)]
    • SOURCE = ‘jpl’ [position (5)]
    • ERR = []
    • GEO = True
    • MSS = False
    • DIM = ‘u10’ [position (8)]
    • OMIT = [] [position (9)]
will produce both data2vector and data2matrix files in “~/imssb_software/output/MISSIONNAME/METHOD/”  with the names representing the input:
    • (1)_(2)_(3)_(4)_(5)_(6a)_c_(6b)_(7)_(8)_(9).nc
where, additional information includes;
    • [position (3)] always set to ‘ssb’
    • [position (4)] software step
    • [position (7)] frequency band of model axes (always Ku band)
The resulting file names in this example are;
    • /data2vector/j2_dir_ssb_data2matrix_jpl_19_c_19_ku_u10_2d.nc
    • /data2matrix/j2_dir_ssb_data2matrix_jpl_19_c_19_ku_u10_2d.npz
Since GEO is True, then an additional file is created (note added “_geo” in file name):
    • /data2matrix/j2_dir_ssb_data2matrix_jpl_19_c_19_ku_u10_2d_geo.npz
If ERR were equal to anything other than [], then the file names would include an additional piece of information in the form of ‘POE_ERR’.
    • Here is an example of ERR=’rms_w’:
        ◦ /data2vector/j2_dir_ssb_data2matrix_jpl_20_c_20_ku_u10_2d_POE_rms_w.nc
        ◦ /data2matrix/j2_dir_ssb_data2matrix_jpl_19_c_19_ku_u10_2d_POE_rms_w.npz
        ◦ /data2matrix/j2_dir_ssb_data2matrix_jpl_19_c_19_ku_u10_2d_geo_POE_rms_w.npz
