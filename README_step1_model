The following instructions are for using the SSB modeling software developed by
Alexa Putnam Shilleh from the University of Colorado Boulder. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step-1: Pull data from product, filter the content, and stack the data by-cycle.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--> Open "run_product2data_ext.py" and define:
        MISSIONNAME: input string corresponding to mission name
            options: 
                'tx' for Topex/Poseidon
                'j1' or "j2" or "j3" for Jason missions 1-3
                's6A' for Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich
                
        cyc: an array containing the numbers for each cycle that will be processed
            i.e. cyc = np.arange(48,101)
            (Bad cycles will be removed. This can be check in lib_dict_ext.py/bad_cycles)
            
        VERSION: input integer to define data format version
            options:
                0 for Topex GDRF
                1 for Jason 1-3 GDRD
                3 for Jason-3 GDRF and Sentinel-6 MF
                4 for Sentinel-3
                
        ALTINTERP: input string that defines whether to interpolate new orbit solution or not. 
            options:
                'full': pull external orbit files, interpolate and add new orbit variable to 
                    altimetry files.
                'part': external files have already been pulled. Just interpolate and 
                    add new orbit variable to altimetry files.
                'none': do not include new orbit solution
            ** additional orbit solutions can be added in lib_dict_ext.py/orbit_paths
        SOURCE: input string corresponding to altimeter data source
            options:
                'jpl' for data received from JPL files
                'aviso' for data received from AVISO
                'rads' for data received from RADS software
            ** additional sources can be added in lib_dict_ext.py/product_paths
                if a new source is added then be sure to make a new directory
                corresponding to the source name in ~/imssb_software/output/mn_template/product2data/
--> Run "run_product2data_ext.py" in command line 


~~~~ Additional notes ~~~~~
Commands:
The aforementioned steps can be carried-out using the following commands within the terminal:
    1. >> cd /path/to/your/directory/imssb_software/iSSB_functions/
    2. >> vi run_product2data_ext.py
        ◦ edit inputs
    3. >> python run_product2data_ext.py

Example:
Running run_product2data_ext.py with the inputs:
    • MISSIONNAME = ‘j2’ [position (1)]
    • cyc = np.arange(19,20) [positions (5a) & (5b)]
    • VERSION = 1
    • ALTINTERP = ‘none’
    • SOURCE = ‘jpl’ [position (4)]
will produce by-cycle files in “~/imssb_software/output/MISSIONNAME/product2data/SOURCE/” with the names representing the input:
    • (1)_(2)_(3)_(4)_(5a)_c_(5b)_na_na.nc
where, additional information includes;
    • [position (2)] always set to ‘dir’ to represent along-track data
    • [position (3)] software step
The resulting file names in this example are;
    • j2_dir_product2data_jpl_19_c_19_na_na.nc
